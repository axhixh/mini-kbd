= QMK firmware for mini-kbd

This is the code necessary to use QMK on mini-kbd. Please use this
until I get it merged into QMK. This was tested with QMK with
git commit a4b124e906de105189415f061d7e64a00e2271d9.

Please copy `keyboards` to the `qmk_firmware` folder where you
have checked out the code for QMK.

Use the following command to build and flash the microcontroller.

```
    qmk flash -kb mini_kbd -km axhixh -bl uf2-split-right
    qmk flash -kb mini_kbd -km axhixh -bl uf2-split-left
```

Please press the `BOOT` button on RP2040-Zero to it in bootloader
mode. Once you have QMK you can do this by double tapping the
`reset` button if you have set one in the keymap.
