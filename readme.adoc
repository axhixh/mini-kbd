= Mini Keyboard


This is my experiment with https://ergogen.xyz[Ergogen] and building
a keyboard from scratch.

I had a bunch of https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2040-Zero[RP2040 Zero]
microcontrollers and Choc Mini switches to play with. Even though I am
used to 34 keys, https://github.com/axhixh/haigha-mod[Haigha Mod], and 
use it as my daily driver, I decided to build one with 36 keys because
I can do that without using diodes.

== Choc v1 vs Choc mini

While I did design this keyboard to play with Choc mini switches, I did
create a Choc v1 version since it was easy with Ergogen and I wanted to
see how to make reversible, hot-swappable PCB.

The Choc mini version of the PCB is in link:choc-mini[] and the Choc v1
version is in link:choc-v1[].

== TRRS vs 4 pin mini DIN 

Inspired by the https://github.com/etiennecollin/wave[Wave Keyboard],
I redesigned the keyboard to use 4 pin mini DIN used by S-video to
protect the microcontroller from
https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_split_keyboard?id=considerations[accidentally shorting].
The layout of the key switches is the same between the different keyboards,
the connection between the two halves is the only difference.

Please download the latest gerber files for the key switch you need from
https://github.com/axhixh/mini-kbd/releases[Releases]

Remember PCB thickness of 1.6mm for Choc mini means the pins will not pass
through the hole. I was fine with this since I use don't use a case.

== Firmware

The `firmware` folder contains different firmwares for the board.
Currently, it supports https://kmkfw.io[KMK] and https://docs.qmk.fm[QMK]

== References

While creating design I used https://github.com/mitxela/kicad-round-tracks[round-track]
plug-in.

The RP2040 Zero footprint is a modified version of https://github.com/CountParadox/RP2040-Zero-Kicad.
A possible improvement for future is to change it to have the origin in the center so
that rotating the footprint is easier.

The footprint for 4 pin mini-DIN is based on the one used in Wave keyboard.
I translated it to Ergogen footprint.
